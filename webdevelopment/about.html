            <p>
                I'm a final-year computer science student at the University of Missouri with a passion for human-computer interaction and machine learning.
                I believe that great programs are not just about functionality but also about creating enjoyable experiences for users.
                Through multiple projects using different web technologies, I have been able to hone skills in fullstack development,
                 machine learning, and database management.
