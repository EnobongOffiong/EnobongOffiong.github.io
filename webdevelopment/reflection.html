                    <span class="first-letter">M</span>y journey into computer science began not in a classroom, but with a desire to solve real problems.
                    I have always been fascinated by how technology can simplify complex tasks, a curiosity that led
                    me to fully commit to CS. That decision was confirmed when I developed a Python tool to analyze
                    over 420,000 records for a research project. Seeing code I wrote eliminate tijme spent on manual work
                        and provide clear insights was incredibly motivating. It showed me that software is not just
                        about writing algorithms, it is about creating tools that help people work smarter.

                </p>

                <p>
                    The projects I have worked on, both in and out of class, have been the most valuable part of my education.
                    Building the Mizzou Exam Scheduler, a full stack app used by students taught me how to think about the
                    entire development lifecycle, from user needs and UI design to database management and deployment. There
                    were countless late nights debugging and tweaking, but each challenge deepened my understanding and
                        resilience. These experiences solidified my interest in full stack development, where I can enjoy both
                        the logic of the backend and the creativity of the frontend. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Looking ahead, my goal is to join a forward thinking tech company as a software engineer,
                    where I can contribute to products that are both technically robust and user centered. I am particularly
                    interested in roles that involve building scalable web applications or working with data intensive systems.
                    I want to be part of a team that values clean code, collaboration, and continuous learning in an environment
                    where I can keep growing while adding meaningful value from day one. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Beyond technical skills, my involvement as a Resident Advisor, VP of the Residence Hall Association,
                    and Peer Learning Assistant has shaped how I approach teamwork and leadership. I have learned how to communicate
                    clearly, manage projects, and help others succeed, skills I believe are just as important as writing efficient 
                    code. I am excited to bring this well rounded perspective to my career, building software that not only works
                    well but also makes a positive difference in people's daily lives.
