            <!-- <p>I'm a software engineer in training with a passion for transforming ideas into clean, functional code.
                 This portfolio is a living document of my journey, showcasing projects that range from simple static
                pages to more complex applications. My goal is to secure an internship or a full-time job where I can
                contribute to a talented team, solve real-world problems, and continue to grow my skills in modern
                 technology and frameworks. Every project here represents a challenge I embraced and a new skill I learned.”</p> -->
